There are plenty of resources explaining what Git, GitHub, and version control are, so we skip the explanation here. 



## Branch Naming Policy & Conventional Commit Message

> [!CAUTION]
>
> ⚠️ Do not use <font color="red">**main branch**</font> to develop! ⚠️

The description of branch names/commit messages makes it easy to understand the purpose of the branch/commit at a glance. 

For more details, please see [Here](https://hackmd.io/@CTFang/H1TWDLz1A).

#### Branch Name Example

- Lower case only
- Kebab Case

```
feature/oauth-support
refactor/oauth-token-ctx
fix/pdu-release
docs/chf-design
```

#### Conventional Commit Message Example

```
test: add unit tests for OAuth2
refactor: consumer, server, processor
docs: update API documentation
fix: resolve PDU release panic
```
